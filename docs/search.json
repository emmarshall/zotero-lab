But as of the writing of this guide it is the most attractive option for academics and students to manage references during writing and research projects.\nZotero works with various operating systems  or  or  and allows you to download references into a personalized library and then create properly formatted in-text citations and bibliographies.\nZotero also enables you to store all your PDFs, notes, and citation meta-data (i.e., information you include in the formatted citation) in the same centralized location (or synced across all your devices using a free online account).",

    "text": "2.2 Why use Zotero?\nAny time we use information from an article, report, or other source, it is important to: - :tada: give credit to others work - :bulb: add credibility to your work - :construction: provide context for your work - :microphone: direct audience to other work\nYet keeping track of references and citations by hands is one of the most tedious parts of the research and writing process. Academics, including those in the field of psychology, tend to use very specific and finicky style formatting guidelines when Psychology, as well as a number of other fields, has adopted a very specific format for references (also see our APA references handouts on Canvas). Unfortunately, there are hundreds of different kinds of sources, and each has a specific way to cite that source. It can be a nightmare to even find the right formatting for the source you have.\nFortunately, there are software packages that can assist us with this task! Zotero is one such program (collectively referred to as reference managers). Zotero is widely used, free (up to a few thousand stored items), and easy to use. Even better, there is a plugin for Microsoft Word that makes creating citations and entire reference pages as easy as clicking a button! We will use Zotero in stats lab to help learn APA format for citations; however, learning to use it now, especially in conjunction with Word, will make writing for other classes easy as well! Zotero provides a one stop shop for storing, managing, and exporting references.",

(This includes creating a Zotero account for online storage of your references) to do is download Zotero\n Download \n\n\nThe installer is ~70MB and the program takes up very little space on your disk) https://www.zotero.org/support/installation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf for some reason you cannot or refuse to download the Zotero program, ZoteroBib offers a free in-browser solution to creating a bibliography.\n\n\nThere are three things you need to do before you can use Zotero effectively:\n\nDownload & Install the desktop app to your computer or device\nCreate a Zotero account (required to sync across devices & use shared-library features)\nSet-up & configure RStudio or Word integration\n(Optional) Install (preferred) Internet browser extension\n\nGo to the Zotero website to download, install and configure Zotero. (This includes creating a Zotero account for online storage of your references)\nFirst, download the Zotero desktop app to your computer or device.\nSecond, install the browser extension.\nZotero Quick Start Guide\nNow, you can start adding sources to Zotero Collections. See the Add a Collection page in this guide for more instructions on how to name a new collection for your research project.\nOr, visit the Zotero Quick Start Guide to learn in more detail about how to use tags and collections in Zotero to organize your references.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: on the download page is a Zotero connector for Firefox – If you use Firefox as a web browser (highly recommended anyway), this adds a button to your browser that detects content (e.g., pdfs of journal articles) when you’re on a page with downloadable content. This makes it a one-click add to download articles directly to Zotero and retrieve the related info.\n\n\nIf you would like to use Zotero directly in Microsoft Word, you can find the plugin here: https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage This functionality is more advanced and will take you a few more minutes to learn to use, but it makes life so much easier! You can still generate references in Zotero without it, but you will need to do them one at a time, and you still need to properly order them on the references page (alphabetically) as well as add the proper hanging indents and line spacing. With the plugin, you add in-text citations as you type your paper, then creating the reference page is as simple as clicking one button!",

    "text": "5.1 Using Zotero\n\n5.1.1 Add a collection\nA collection is like a folder. You will want to create a new collection for each project or paper you are working on.\n\n\n5.1.2 Add an item\nAdding articles (or other items such as book chapters) to Zotero couldn’t be easier. Simply open Zotero, then drag and drop the pdf into “My Library” in the left pane. You can set up different “collections”, which is helpful to organize references by class assignment, for example, but this is not necessary unless you wish to do so.\n\n\n5.1.3 Zotero desktop app add item menu\nSelect an item type, then enter citation information in the pane on the right. Refer to your Bluebook to know what information to enter. You may need to leave some fields blank. For example, you would not enter an author for a case.\n\n\n5.1.4 Zotero “Items”\nIn Zotero, an item is simply a kind of entry in your library. It may be an article pdf, a book chapter pdf, or even a web address. In your library (the left pane), you will see a list of all of the items you have saved in Zotero. The entry you see is just the info… to read the item, click on the drop-down arrow at the left of the item and it will display the pdf – double click this to open it in the PDF Reader. This is an important distinction – clicking the entry itself will display the related Metadata (see below), or information about the item. Clicking the pdf from the drop down will not show that metadata.\nMetadata is the term for the information about the item you are adding, for example a journal article has information associated with it which we need to create a reference – info such as the title of the paper, the author(s) name(s), the date it was published and the journal name. The good news is that when you add a new item, Zotero automatically searches for the metadata on the web. It is available roughly 90% of the time for articles published in the last 20 years or so. The rest of the time, it will have some, but not all, of the info.\nEditing Metadata is necessary when some, or all, of the item info is not automatically added to Zotero. Click the entry for the item in your library (see above), which displays the item’s metadata in the right-side pane. Clicking inside this pane allows you to enter info or in some cases, such as item type, to select from a drop-down menu. This is the most important step of adding an item to your Zotero library. When you ask it to create a citation or reference page for you, it will pull the necessary info from this pane. If this info is absent or incorrect, the citation will also be incorrect! Using the APA references handout(s), identify the correct type of item that you have (most often this is a journal article). Now, look to see what info is included in a citation for that item type – make sure that the corresponding fields in the metadata in Zotero are filled out and accurate!\n\n\n5.1.5 Creating Citations\nTo create individual citations, simply right click on the item’s entry in your library, select “Create Bibliography from Selected Item(s)”, choose APA 7th edition, and copy to clipboard. You can now paste it into Word (or anywhere else). https://www.zotero.org/support/creating_bibliographies\nAgain, using the Word plugin is infinitely more efficient, you can find those instructions here: https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage\n\n\n5.1.6 Creating Items Manually\nWe can’t always find that PDF of an article we are looking for, sometimes it’s behind a paywall or it simply doesn’t exist on the web. Maybe you want to cite an encyclopedia, but can’t get the PDF of the whole thing, or even the entry… no problem. What we want to do here, is still be able to use Zotero to create the citation for us, so we will manually add an item to our library. In this case, the item won’t actually contain the PDF, but this will allow us to add the metadata by hand so that Zotero can create the citation. Use this to create the item: https://www.zotero.org/support/adding_items_to_zotero And then, refer to the metadata sections above to add the relevant info.\n\n\n5.1.7 Add a citation style\nAPA Manual - 7th edition examples\nWithin the Repository, you can search by style name. Also, you may install a style from a local file on your computer. When you add a style to your Repository, it will appear in your word processor plugin, and you can use it when you add citations and bibliographies to your writing.\nFor additional information on using styles within Zotero, see Zotero’s Citation Styles page.\nNavigate to preferences\nZotero desktop application edit menu with preferences selected\nOpen the Edit menu and select Preferences.\nGet additional styles\nZotero desktop application Preferences dialog\nIn the Preferences window, select Cite from the tabs along the top. Since the Bluebook style isn’t among those listed, select Get additional styles…\nIn the box that appears, search for “Bluebook”. Select Bluebook Law Review for the footnote citation style (Bluebook white pages) or Bluebook Inline for in-text citations (Bluebook blue pages). The selected style should now appear in the Preferences dialog. Select OK to exit Preferences.\n\n\n5.1.8 Generating Citations\nWord processor plugins Download a plugin Zotero allows you to automatically generate citations for sources in your Zotero library and add those citations directly into a document as you type. To take advantage of this feature, you should first download a plugin that is compatible with your word processor. The Zotero page on word processor integration has links to plugins for Word, LibreOffice, and third-party plugins for other programs. The Zotero integration with Google Docs is included in the browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. See the link above for instructions on how to download and use Zotero in the word processor of your choice.\n\n\n5.1.9 Legal Citations\n(Bluebook) or The Indigo Book\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuris-M\n\n\n\nZotero has only limited support for creating citations for legal cases and documents. But for more lew heavy projects you can use Juris-M, a community-driven unofficial version of Zotero specifically designed for compliance with legal citation requirements. It it built on the same code, so it works the same way, and you can even use the same zotero account.\nFor a more in depth guide to using Zotero or Jurism for legal scholarship and citation go here\n\n\nEditing citations As noted above, you will need to edit the citations generated by Zotero because they will not always adhere to Bluebook rules. Since the Zotero citations are dynamically linked to your Zotero library, however, your edits will disappear when your citations refresh unless you take the steps below:\nType your document and insert citations as you type. Leave incorrectly-formatted citations as is for now. You can keep track of the edits you will need to make using comments in the document. Check over the accuracy of all your bibliographic information. Do this by checking the sources in your Zotero library using the desktop client. Select “Refresh” (the icon is a blank page with green arrows pointing in a circle:Zotero refresh icon) in your Zotero plugin or in the Zotero menu on Google Docs to see the changes reflected in your citations. When you are sure that you have cited all the sources you plan to cite, and that the information for these sources is entered correctly in your library, select “Unlink Citations” (the icon is a broken chain: ). This action is irreversible so do not unlink until you are done citing. Now your citations have been converted to regular text, and you can go through your document and edit them as necessary. Even if you aren’t editing your citations, you should unlink them when you have finished the document in order to preserve your work as is.\n\n\n5.1.10 Tips & Tricks\n\nGeneralAdd tagsGetting helpSyncing with the CloudRstudio, Rmarkdown and all thatStep 6: Connecting Rstudio to ZoteroCreating the bibliographyStep 8: Getting the references in the proper formatMake Rstudio output to Word for our collaborators\n\n\nThis page covers how to add tags, search within tags, back up your Zotero Library, and where to find help for using Zotero.\n\n\nThe Tags tab shows the tags that were included with the article when the item was first created by Zotero. You can also add your own tags here.\nScreen capture of Zotero desktop application tags tab\nIf Zotero detects metadata as part of a catalog record associated with the item you saved, Zotero will sometimes add that information as a tag.\nZotero displays tags for library items in the lower, left corner.\nZotero desktop application tags pane\nClick on a tag to see all items in your Zotero Library associated with that tag.\nNote that you can search all items saved in Zotero using the search bar at the top. Search by the name of any field or tag.\n\n\nThere are many resources on the Internet for understanding how Zotero works and using Zotero to organize references.\nAs you begin to use Zotero, review the Zotero Quick Start Guide which includes detailed information on both automatically and manually adding items to Zotero, searching within Zotero, creating bibliographies, and answers to frequently asked questions.\nAnother resource to consider is the Zotero Support page which includes the above-mentioned information as well as information on Zotero plugins.\nAsk questions about Zotero, search for answers, and discuss features of Zotero in the Zotero Forums. You must have a Zotero account to post comments in the Zotero forums.\n\n\nBack up your Zotero library\nYour Zotero data directory contains your entire Zotero library.\nThere are two ways you can back up your data directory so that you will still have your information if your hard drive crashes.\nSync to the cloud with Zotero\nWhen you create a Zotero account, you can set up automatic sync with an online version of your Zotero library. This option also allows you to access your Zotero library from any computer with an internet connection. Read about setting up sync on the Zotero website.\nFind the Zotero data directory on your computer\nYou can also locate the Zotero data directory on your computer and include it in your usual data backup procedures.\nFirst, find where your data directory is located.\nNavigate to the Edit menu and then click on Preferences.\nZotero Desktop edit menu with arrow pointing to Preferences\nIn the Zotero Preferences menu that opens, click on Advanced. Then select the Files and Folders tab.\nFrom here, you may either click on “Show Data Directory” or navigate to the location shown for the data directory here.\n\n5.1.10.1 Zotero Desktop Preferences dialog\nImportant: Before backing up your data directory, close your web browser and the Zotero desktop application.\nBack up the data directory however you prefer. For example, you can copy the folder to an external storage device.\n\n\n6 Using Zotero with RMarkdown or Quarto\nSetup   ## Create stable citation keys\nWhile writing our papers, we want short but recognizable identifier keys for our citations. For this we use the “Better BibTex for Zotero” Add-on. Go to the Better Bibtex website and follow the installation instructions.\nIn the Zotero preferences (Better bibtex tab), I changed the “Citation Key Format” to create keys like verhoeven_etal20.\n[auth.etal:lower:replace=.,_][&gt;0][shortyear]|[veryshorttitle][shortyear]\n(This snippet comes from Dewey Dunnington’s blog that was a big help in getting my workflow up and running)\nThis should automatically create / update all the citations keys in Zotero.\n\n6.0.1 Word plug-in\nIf you would like to use Zotero directly in Microsoft Word, you can find the plugin here: https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage\nThis functionality is more advanced and will take you a few more minutes to learn to use, but it makes life so much easier! You can still generate references in Zotero without it, but you will need to do them one at a time, and you still need to properly order them on the references page (alphabetically) as well as add the proper hanging indents and line spacing. With the plugin, you add in-text citations as you type your paper, then creating the reference page is as simple as clicking one button!\n\n\n\n\nRstudio is where we actually write the paper. We use the .Rmd Rmarkdown format. This format consists of a YAML header, followed by a body that consists of Markdown formatted text with optional code chunks, figures and tables interspersed. Version control is through Git.\nImportant thing to check: make sure that your .Rmd file uses UTF-8 encoding. In Rstudio, File --&gt; Save with Encoding --&gt; UTF-8 can set this straight if somehow you ended up with a file in the wrong encoding.\nCheck the Rstudio website for more info on Rmarkdown.\nNote The latest version of Rstudio (1.4) contains a new editing mode for Rmarkdown, “the visual markdown editor”, that contains support for inserting citations from Zotero. I am not sure yet whether I like this, and noted that on my system, it was still buggy, and the editor, when invoked, makes CHANGES to the markdown code. Brrr. Therefore, this blog post does not make use of this new feature.\n\n\nHold on, almost there. We’re in Rstudio, and writing our paper. Now comes the moment where we want to cite something! Now we need a connection to Zotero. There are two Rstudio Addins that compete for this functionality, citr and rbbt. Both packages are not on CRAN and therefore need to be installed from Github. I tried them both out, and went for rbbt as citr does not support CSL-JSON and rbbt appears slightly leaner.\nremotes::install_github(\"paleolimbot/rbbt\")\nAfter installing and restarting Rstdio, the rbbt addin can be found under Addins. Now since citing stuff is a common activity while writing a paper, we want a keyboard shortcut for this. I put it under CTRL + K where K stand for errr, Knowledge ?\nTo bind rbbt to a particular keyboard shortcut, do the following: First, in RStudio, choose Tools --&gt; Modify Keyboard Shortcuts. Type zotero to filter out the Zotero plugin. Click on the ‘Shortcut’ field for the ‘Insert Zotero citation’ addin row, and type the desired shortcut keys.\nIn Rstudio, we can now press CTRL+K, type the name of the first author, select the citation, press enter, and have the citation key added to our .Rmd document.\n\n\nNow that we have an Rmarkdown document filled with citation keys that references citations in Zotero, we still need one more thing, and that is to create the actual .bib or .json file containing the cited references.\nHere I describe the simplest approach. We go to Zotero and export all the references using “Export Collection” , and choosing CSL JSON, save the file as references.json in the same folder as your Rmd paper. CSL-JSON is an emerging standard that is recommended by Yihui Xie, author of Rmarkdown.\nIn Rstudio, we add to following line to our YAML header:\nbibliography: references.json\nrbbt has the functionality to automatically create a bib/json file that ONLY contains the references that are cited in the Rmd document. I haven’t tested this yet, but this would be the icing on the cake. Instructions for this are on the rbbt Github page.\nUpdate 03/2023 You can try adding the following entry to your YAML header:\nbibliography: \"`r rbbt::bbt_write_bib('bibliography.json', overwrite = TRUE)`\" \n\n\nAt this point, we can knit our Rmarkdown document, and it will contain the cited references appended at the end of the HTML/PDF/Word generated output document.\nHowever, the references are (most likely) not yet properly formatted for the journal we want to send it to. For example, the journal “Health Services Research” wants the references in the main text to be numbered, and the reference list sorted in the order of appearance, and formatted according the APA format (whatever that is).\nLuckily for us, enter the Citation Style Language project. They created a common standard, CSL, and a crowdsourced repository, that contains more than 10.000 free citation styles. All we need to do is grab the CSL file for our target journal!\nGo to the Zotero Style Repository , search for the target journal name (in my case Health Services Research) and click on the result. This downloads a CSL file that we add to our Git repo containing the manuscript.\n\n\nStill here? Great. Now we are ready for the final step. This one is for our collaborators (who we feel sorry for, because they use Word and miss out on all the Rmarkdown fun), and for those journals, that force us to submit our manuscript as a Word file.\nIn Rstudio, we add the following code to the YAML header:\noutput:\n  word_document:\n    reference_docx: style_template.docx\nThis tells Rmarkdown to use the Word formatting styles contained in the style_template.docx file. For me, this contains at the moment three things: A4 page size, double line spacing, and numbered lines.\nFollow the instructions by Rstudio to make this template. In short, you let Rstudio’s pandoc generate a Word document from a .Rmd file, and tweak the formatting styles of that document. Name the document style_template.docx and keep it with your .Rmd manuscript. I can confirm that this also works when you edit this document using LibreOffice / OpenOffice.",
