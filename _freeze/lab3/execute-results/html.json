Below is a list of: DOI links that will take you to a number of different sources, some webpages, and info for other types of sources for which you will need to track down what is needed to create a Zotero entry. Note: Do NOT use the URL in the Zotero reference unless it is needed for that source type… you may be given the URL below simply because that’s how we are pointing you to the source, not necessarily because you should include the URL. For some of the sources, we have provided you with info that may lead you directly, or indirectly, to a webpage where you can’t actually access the PDF. Use what you learned in lab to track down the PDF copy (it’s actually pretty simple), if you want to have Zotero find the metadata for you instead of doing it manually!\n:::\n\n::: objectives\n## For Each Numbered item\n\n-   [ ] **Search**: Determine which kind of source it is and create a Zotero entry for each one (under a new collection, e.g., APA refs take home). \n-   [ ] **Record**: Ensure that all of the necessary meta-data is entered into the right-side panel of Zotero and that capitalization etc. is correct.\n-   [ ] **Export**: Confirm that you entered the info correctly by copy and paste-ing it into the boxes on this page\n-   [ ] **Submit**: In Zotero, **GENERATE A REPORT FROM COLLECTION* and paste the information into the Lab 3 assignment on Canvas.\n:::\n\n::: vspace2\n:::\n\n## Prepare for Today\n\n::: readings\n-   [ ] Read the [Syllabus](https://emmarshall.github.io/PSYC181-UNL/SUM24/syllabus.qmd)\n\n:::\n\n\n::: takeaways\nThe answer is typically in the syllabus or on the site. \n\nBut if it isn't, do not hesitate to reach out or set up a one-on-one meeting. \n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n1)  Set up Zotero: You may use Zotero on the lab computers or install Zotero on your own laptop (preferred).\n\n2)  Familiarize yourself with Zotero (walkthrough)\n\n\ni)  Create a new collection called “\\[your name\\] APA references worksheet”\nii) Adding your first PDF\n\n**EXAMPLE:** Perform a [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) search for “Hicks, Humphries & Slater (2024)” `DOI:10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5`\n\n(1) Download a {{< fa file-pdf >}} copy of the article.\n(2) Drag & drop this file into your APA references worksheet collection in Zotero, note that metadata retrieval is automatic. Note: Adding an item to a collection automatically adds it to your library as well.\n(3) Click on the item that is created, and inspect the right-side info pane, what kind of info is there?\n(4) Using the Journal Reference Checklist handout, make sure that all of the necessary journal article reference information is present in the right-side pane.\n(5) Right-click on this item in your collection, select create bibliography, choose APA 7th edition, we want to output as a bibliography and copy to the clipboard. Paste the citation below (5-points) and be sure to delete the automatic numbering that Word will insert in front of it:\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n\n## Practice Question\n\nA 2024 Journal Article Titled \"ChatGPT is bullshit\" published in *Ethics and Information Technology*\n\n| The APA 7 citation is: \n\n<input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='60' data-answer='[\"Hicks, M.
